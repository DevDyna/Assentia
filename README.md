# Description:

Many modpacks have a "early game" when you craft a crafting table , place down and craft what you need or after many "stages" you can craft a crafting table.

Ok , so this modpack didn't have a crafting table !

You need to explore dimensions , trade with villagers , obtain new unusual storages , mine stranger ores , survive with pollution and limited light source , kill various bosses ,  find dungeons with many loot , build structures to craft items and only at the end of all obtain once !

 

 

# Feature:
